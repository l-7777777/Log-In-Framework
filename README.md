# Log In Framework
A framework for creating login pages
## How to create a login page
Our page creator is not yet out, so you will have to do this manually.
1. Clone or download the repo
2. Edit config.php to match your needs
3. Upload the files to a server, or run your own. Start with login.html, then try signup.html
4. Troubleshoot if it doesn't work: 
    * Look through the code and try to figure it out
    * Post an issue here
5. Make some html to go inside of loggedin.php, login.html and signup.html.
## Our page creator
We are building a tool in the /pagecreator directory that will write html and css code for you. All you have to do is tell it what you want. And the best part is, it produces clean, clear code.
